This is a bot for parsing pages in VKontakte using Telegram.
Commands for the bot are in help_text in config. They are available in both English and Russian.
But I will still write these same commands here:
help - displays a list of all commands.
start - when entering this command, you must specify the user id after the @ sign (without this sign).
online - displays online or not the user you selected.
count_of_friends - a command that shows how many users you have selected.
counters - basic information about the page (number of subscribers, friends, albums, videos, audio files, and posts).
get_subscriptions - a command that shows how many subscribers the user you selected has.
get_url - returns a link to the user.
avatar - displays the user's avatar with a resolution of 50% out of 100.
phonenumber - a command that gives the user's phone number if it is not blocked by the privacy settings.
status - displays the user's status on the page.
names - displays the name and family of the user you selected.
mobile - displays from your phone or computer in VKontakte your user. Or it shows that the user is not online.
More commands (also in Russian) can be found on the help command. Before the command, you need to put a sign /.
When downloading, you need to download all files (except start. bat, this is just a launcher for the bot in the console)
